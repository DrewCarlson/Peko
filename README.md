### Android Permissions with Kotlin Coroutines
No more callbacks, builders, listeners or verbose code for requesting Android permissions.  
Get Permission Request Result asynchronously with one function call.  
Thanks to [Kotlin Coroutines](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines), permissions requests are async and lightweight (no new threads are used/created).

***

### Installation

Add `jcenter` repository

```
compile 'com.markodevcic.peko:peko:0.31'
```

### Example 
In an Activity or a Fragment:
```kotlin
launch (UI) {
    val permissionResultDeferred = activity.requestPermissionsAsync(Manifest.permission.BLUETOOTH, Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE) 
    val (grantedPermissions) = permissionResultDeferred.await()
    
    if (Manifest.permission.BLUETOOTH in grantedPermissions) {
        //we have Bluetooth permission
    } else {
        //no Bluetooth permission
    }
}
```

### Screen rotations
Library has support for screen rotations. 
When activity get's recreated, coroutines that have not completed yet, have to be cancelled to avoid memory leaks.
When you detect a orientation change, cancel the coroutine with an instance of `ActivityRotatingException`. Internally, this will retain the current request that is in progress. The `Deferred` can then be awaited again by calling `Peko.resultDeferred`.

Example:

First:
```kotlin

//job that will be cancelled in onDestroy
private val job = Job()

private fun requestPermission(vararg permissions: String) {
    launch(job + UI) { // combine job with UI context
        val result = this@MainActivity.requestPermissionsAsync(*permissions).await()
        setResults(result)
    }
}
```

Then in `onDestroy` of an Activity:
```kotlin
if (isChangingConfigurations) {
    job.cancel(ActivityRotatingException()) //screen rotation, retain the results
} else { 
    job.cancel() //no rotation, just cancel the coroutine
}
``` 

And when this Activity gets recreated in one of the Activity lifecycle functions, e.g.`onCreate`:
```kotlin

//check if we have a request already (or some other way you detect screen orientation)
if (activity.isRequestingPermissions()) {
    launch (UI) {
        //get the existing request and await the result
        val result = Peko.resultDeferred!!.await()
        setResults(result)
    }
}
```

### Permission Rationales
If you want to show a permission rationale to the user, you can use the built in `AlertDialogPermissionRationale`. This will show an Alert Dialog with your message and title, explaining to user why this rationale is needed. It will be shown only once and only if user denies the permission for the first time.

```kotlin
val rationale = AlertDialogPermissionRationale(this@MainActivity) {
    this.setTitle("Need permissions")
    this.setMessage("Please give permissions to use this feature")	
}

launch (UI) {
    val permissionResult = Peko.requestPermissionsAsync(this, Manifest.permission.BLUETOOTH, rationale = rationale).await()
}
```

There is also a `SnackBarRationale` class that shows a SnackBar when permission rationale is required.

```kotlin
val snackBar = Snackbar.make(rootView, "Permissions needed to continue", Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG)
val snackBarRationale = SnackBarRationale(snackBar, actionTitle = "Request again")

launch(UI) {
    val permissionResult = Peko.requestPermissionsAsync(this@MainActivity, *permissions, rationale = snackBarRationale).await()
}
```

You can also show your own implementation of Permission Rationale to the user. Just implement the interface `PermissionRationale`. If `true` is returned from suspend function `shouldRequestAfterRationaleShownAsync`, permissions will be asked for again, otherwise the request completes and returns the current permission result.
